I am a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/), where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Roberto Navigli](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli/). My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), Question Answering, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Evaluation, and Reasoning.

## Experience

**Applied Scientist Intern** (May 2025 – Oct. 2025)
Amazon AGI – Barcelona, Spain
Trained Long-Context Language Models with Reinforcement Learning to augment in-context retrieval capabilities.

**NLP Engineer** (June 2022 – July 2023)
Babelscape – Rome, Italy
Evaluated state-of-the-art language models for cross-lingual sentence embeddings, developed sentence alignment algorithms based on semantic similarity, and implemented fast and efficient entity disambiguation systems.

**Data Scientist** (Nov. 2021 – May 2022)
Target Reply – Rome, Italy
